  "The answer-set *objective* surface: `(asp/minimize priority ?weight body)` and a
  priority-tagged `(set/softConstraint P (implies …))`.  Both normalize into an internal
  soft constraint whose consequent marker carries the operands (`rules/normalize-minimize`
  / `rules/normalize-soft-priority`), so `solve-context` reads the level and per-head
  weight back (`rules/soft-cost-of`) and `edge/translate` emits them as ASPIF minimize
  statements at distinct lexicographic levels.

  The point is the plateau: a maximum matching has many equal-cost optima, and a
  lower-priority weighted minimize breaks the tie to a unique answer without the higher
  objective ever trading a match for a cheaper weight.  End-to-end tests need an ASP
  backend, so they are guarded on `asp?`; the normalize/rewrap unit tests are not."
